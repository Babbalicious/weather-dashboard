# Weather Dashboard

## Purpose

This is a simple weather forecast application that allows users to search a city by name, and get today's weather along with a 5-day forecast for the city.

Cities that were searched previously are included in a list of buttons below the search bar and can be re-searched by clicking the button.

The app uses local storage in the browser to remember what cities have been searched for before.
